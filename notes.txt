
Ideas for dirmi:

- Bidirectional
- Operates on a single InputStream and OutputStream pair
- Uses @Remote annotation on interface, method (return value), or parameter.
- Byte and character streams supported
- Custom annotation describes how other kinds of streams can be connected
- How about custom annotation which can describe how anything is relayed?
  Can @Remote be defined this way? @Stream?
- Custom annotation handler is just given a raw stream to play with. Default
  annotation is @Object, which creates a new Object stream.
- Perhaps session ID is passed to handler too? To keep things separate?
- Can use @Asynchronous annotation for methods that return void and declare no exceptions.
